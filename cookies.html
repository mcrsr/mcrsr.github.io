                    <h2>Cookies</h2>
                    <p>Cookies let you store user information in web pages.
                    </p>
                    <h3>What are Cookies?</h3>
                    <p>Cookies are small pieces of data that a website or online service stores on a user's device (usually within their web browser) while the user is browsing or interacting with the site. Cookies can contain various types of information, such as user preferences, session identifiers, shopping cart contents, and more. When the user visits the website again, the browser sends these cookies back to the server, allowing the website to recognize the user and retrieve their stored information.</p>
                    <p>Cookies are data, stored in small text files, on your computer.
                        When a web server has sent a web page to a browser, the connection is shut down, and the server
                        forgets everything about the user.
                        Cookies were invented to solve the problem "how to remember information about the user":
                        When a user visits a web page, his/her name can be stored in a cookie.
                        Next time the user visits the page, the cookie "remembers" his/her name.
                        Cookies are saved in name-value pairs like:
                        username = John Doe
                        When a browser requests a web page from a server, cookies belonging to the page are added to the
                        request. This way the server gets the necessary data to "remember" information about users.
                    </p>
                    <p>HTTP cookies (also called web cookies, Internet cookies, browser cookies, or simply cookies) are
                        small blocks of data created by a web server while a user is browsing a website and placed on
                        the user's computer or other device by the user's web browser. Cookies are placed on the device
                        used to access a website, and more than one cookie may be placed on a user's device during a
                        session.
                    </p>
                    <p><b>Types of Cookies:</b></p>
                    <p><b>Session Cookies:</b> These cookies are temporary and are erased from the device's memory once the user closes the web browser. They are typically used to maintain session information, such as login status or items in a shopping cart during a single browsing session.</p>
                    <p><b>Persistent Cookies:</b> These cookies are stored on the user's device even after the browser is closed. They have an expiration date and remain active until that date is reached, or until the user manually deletes them. Persistent cookies are often used for remembering user preferences and login information across multiple sessions.</p>
                    <p><b>First-party Cookies:</b> These cookies are set by the website that the user is currently visiting. They are primarily used to remember user settings and preferences for that specific website.</p>
                    <p><b>Third-party Cookies:</b> These cookies are set by domains other than the one the user is currently visiting. They are often used for tracking users across different websites for purposes like targeted advertising.</p>
                    <p><b>Importance of Cookies:</b></p>
                    <p>User Convenience: Cookies play a significant role in enhancing user experience. They allow websites to remember user preferences and settings, such as language preferences, layout choices, and font sizes. This means that users don't have to reconfigure these settings every time they visit a site.</p>
                    <p>Authentication and Session Management: Cookies are essential for managing user sessions. When you log into a website, a session cookie is often used to maintain your logged-in status as you navigate different pages. Without cookies, you would need to log in again for each page you visit.</p>
                    <p>Personalization: Cookies enable websites to offer personalized content and recommendations. They track user behavior and interactions, allowing websites to tailor content to individual users' interests.</p>
                    <p>Shopping Carts and E-commerce: Cookies are often used to store items in a shopping cart. This way, users can continue shopping and adding items to their cart even if they navigate to different pages. Persistent cookies also remember items in the cart for future visits.</p>
                    <p>Tracking and Analytics: Websites use cookies to collect data on user behavior, such as pages visited, time spent on pages, and interactions. This data is then used for analytics to understand user engagement and improve website performance.</p>
                    <p>Targeted Advertising: Third-party cookies are frequently used by advertisers to track users across various websites and deliver targeted ads based on their browsing habits and interests.</p>
