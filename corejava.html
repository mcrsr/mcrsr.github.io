                <h1>Exceptions</h1>
            <h3>What Is an Exception?</h3>
            <p>The term exception is shorthand for the phrase "exceptional event."</p>
            <b>Definition: An exception is an event, which occurs during the execution of a program, that disrupts the normal flow of the program's instructions. </b>
            <p>When an error occurs within a method, the method creates an object and hands it off to the runtime system. The object, called an exception object, contains information about the error, including its type and the state of the program when the error occurred. Creating an exception object and handing it to the runtime system is called throwing an exception.</p>
            <p>After a method throws an exception, the runtime system attempts to find something to handle it. The set of possible "somethings" to handle the exception is the ordered list of methods that had been called to get to the method where the error occurred. The list of methods is known as the call stack (see the next figure).</p>
            <img src="./images/exceptions-callstack.gif" alt="exceptions-callstack" style="margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto;display: block;">
            <p>The runtime system searches the call stack for a method that contains a block of code that can handle the exception. This block of code is called an exception handler. The search begins with the method in which the error occurred and proceeds through the call stack in the reverse order in which the methods were called. When an appropriate handler is found, the runtime system passes the exception to the handler. An exception handler is considered appropriate if the type of the exception object thrown matches the type that can be handled by the handler.</p>
            <p>The exception handler chosen is said to catch the exception. If the runtime system exhaustively searches all the methods on the call stack without finding an appropriate exception handler, as shown in the next figure, the runtime system (and, consequently, the program) terminates.</p>
            <img src="./images/exceptions-errorOccurs.gif" alt="exceptions-callstack" style="margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto;display: block;">
            <p>Using exceptions to manage errors has some advantages over traditional error-management techniques. You can learn more in the Advantages of Exceptions section.</p>
            <h3>The Catch or Specify Requirement</h3>
            <p>Valid Java programming language code must honor the Catch or Specify Requirement. This means that code that might throw certain exceptions must be enclosed by either of the following:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>A try statement that catches the exception. The try must provide a handler for the exception.</li>
                <li>A method that specifies that it can throw the exception. The method must provide a throws clause that lists the exception.</li>
            </ul>
            </div>
            <div id="properties">
                <h1>Properties</h1>
                <p>Properties are configuration values managed as key/value pairs. In each pair, the key and value are both String values. The key identifies, and is used to retrieve, the value, much as a variable name is used to retrieve the variable's value. For example, an application capable of downloading files might use a property named "download.lastDirectory" to keep track of the directory used for the last download.</p>
                <p>To manage properties, create instances of java.util.Properties. This class provides methods for the following:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>loading key/value pairs into a Properties object from a stream,</li>
                    <li>retrieving a value from its key,</li>
                    <li>listing the keys and their values,</li>
                    <li>enumerating over the keys, and</li>
                    <li>saving the properties to a stream.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Properties extends java.util.Hashtable. Some of the methods inherited from Hashtable support the following actions:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>testing to see if a particular key or value is in the Properties object,</li>
                    <li>getting the current number of key/value pairs,</li>
                    <li>removing a key and its value,</li>
                    <li>adding a key/value pair to the Properties list,</li>
                    <li>enumerating over the values or the keys,</li>
                    <li>retrieving a value by its key, and</li>
                    <li>finding out if the Properties object is empty.</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Setting Up the Properties Object</h4>
                <pre>
// create and load default properties
Properties defaultProps = new Properties();
FileInputStream in = new FileInputStream("defaultProperties");
defaultProps.load(in);
in.close();
                </pre>
                <h4>Saving Properties</h4>
                <pre>
                    <code>
FileOutputStream out = new FileOutputStream("appProperties");
applicationProps.store(out, "---No Comment---");
out.close();
                    </code>
                </pre>
                <h4>Getting Property Information</h4>
                <p>Once the application has set up its Properties object, the application can query the object for information about various keys and values that it contains. An application gets information from a Properties object after start up so that it can initialize itself based on choices made by the user. The Properties class has several methods for getting property information:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>contains(Object value) and containsKey(Object key)</li>
                    <p>Returns true if the value or the key is in the Properties object. Properties inherits these methods from Hashtable. Thus they accept Object arguments, but only String values should be used.</p>
                    <li>getProperty(String key) and getProperty(String key, String default)</li>
                    <p>Returns the value for the specified property. The second version provides for a default value. If the key is not found, the default is returned.</p>
                    <li>list(PrintStream s) and list(PrintWriter w)</li>
                    <p>Writes all of the properties to the specified stream or writer. This is useful for debugging.</p>
                    <li>size()</li>
                    <p>Returns the current number of key/value pairs.</p>
                </ul>
                <h4>Setting Properties</h4>
                <p>A user's interaction with an application during its execution may impact property settings. These changes should be reflected in the Properties object so that they are saved when the application exits (and calls the store method). The following methods change the properties in a Properties object:</p>
                <pre>
setProperty(String key, String value)
Puts the key/value pair in the Properties object.
remove(Object key)
Removes the key/value pair associated with key.
                </pre>
            </div>

            <div id="system_properties">
                <h1>System Properties</h1>
                <p>In Properties, we examined the way an application can use Properties objects to maintain its configuration. The Java platform itself uses a Properties object to maintain its own configuration. The System class maintains a Properties object that describes the configuration of the current working environment. System properties include information about the current user, the current version of the Java runtime, and the character used to separate components of a file path name.</p>
                <p>The following table describes some of the most important system properties</p>
                <pre>
    Key	                             Meaning
"file.separator"	Character that separates components of a file path. This is "/" on UNIX and "\" on Windows.
"java.class.path"	Path used to find directories and JAR archives containing class files. Elements of the class path are separated by a platform-specific character specified in the path.separator property.
"java.home"	        Installation directory for Java Runtime Environment (JRE)
"java.vendor"	    JRE vendor name
"java.vendor.url"	JRE vendor URL
"java.version"	    JRE version number
"line.separator"	Sequence used by operating system to separate lines in text files
"os.arch"	        Operating system architecture
"os.name"	        Operating system name
"os.version"	    Operating system version
"path.separator"	Path separator character used in java.class.path
"user.dir"	        User working directory
"user.home"	        User home directory
"user.name"	        User account name
                </pre>
                <H4>Reading System Properties</H4>
                <P>The System class has two methods used to read system properties: getProperty and getProperties.</P>
                <P>System.getProperty("path.separator");</P>
                <P>The getProperty method returns a string containing the value of the property. If the property does not exist, this version of getProperty returns null.</P>
                <H4>Writing System Properties</H4>
                <pre>
                    <code>
 import java.io.FileInputStream;
import java.util.Properties;

public class PropertiesTest {
    public static void main(String[] args)
        throws Exception {

        // set up new properties object
        // from file "myProperties.txt"
        FileInputStream propFile =
            new FileInputStream( "myProperties.txt");
        Properties p =
            new Properties(System.getProperties());
        p.load(propFile);

        // set the system properties
        System.setProperties(p);
        // display new properties
        System.getProperties().list(System.out);
    }
}
                    </code>
                </pre>
            </div>

            <div id="Environment_Variables">
                <h1>Environment Variables</h1>
                <p>Many operating systems use environment variables to pass configuration information to applications. Like properties in the Java platform, environment variables are key/value pairs, where both the key and the value are strings. The conventions for setting and using environment variables vary between operating systems, and also between command line interpreters. To learn how to pass environment variables to applications on your system, refer to your system documentation.</p>
                <p>On the Java platform, an application uses System.getenv to retrieve environment variable values. Without an argument, getenv returns a read-only instance of java.util.Map, where the map keys are the environment variable names, and the map values are the environment variable values. This is demonstrated in the EnvMap example:</p>
                <pre>
                    <code>
import java.util.Map;

public class EnvMap {
    public static void main (String[] args) {
        Map<String, String> env = System.getenv();
        for (String envName : env.keySet()) {
            System.out.format("%s=%s%n",
                              envName,
                              env.get(envName));
        }
    }
}
                    </code>
